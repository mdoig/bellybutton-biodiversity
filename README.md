# Belly Button Biodiversity

This dashboard utilizes Plotly.js charts to show information on individual samples from the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

According to the project's creators, they launched the initiative "to investigate the microbes inhabiting our navels and the factors that might influence the microscopic life calling this protected, moist patch of skin home. In addition to inspiring scientific curiosity, _Belly Button Biodiversity_ inspired conversations about the beneficial roles microbes play in our daily lives."
